# BreastCancer-PredictModel

Our primary objective is to build a classication model that accurately predicts the outcome (be-
nign/malignant) using brca_train and apply the final model to brca_test to classify the remaining 171 observations and report our test accuracy. Our secondary objective is to identify signicant pre-
dictors of malignant breast cancer to help inform oncologists.

Given that the response variable is binary and all predictors are continuous, we will consider using the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
